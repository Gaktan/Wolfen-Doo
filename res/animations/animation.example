* Just like maps, animations have their own configuration system.
* It now allows you to have inner commands
* It is not mandatory (but might be in the future), but recommanded that each animation file should 
* match a specific sprites image

* Width and height of the image {int}
-> imageSize{512}

* Width and height of a single sprite (they must all be the same size) {int}
-> frameSize{128}

* For every animation, you must create a new animation command. 
* sub commands work exactly like commands except they are written with [] instead of {}
* An animation is identified by it's name so make sure you don't use the same twice

* It is extremely important that you follow this order
* name
* frames
* delays

* Otherwise it might crash

* Frames are the sprites number you want to play in order
* Top left sprite is 0, then 1, etc...

* Delays are in ms. You can specify the delay between each frame or
* Just put one value and it will be the delay for every single frames

* Here are some examples :

animation{
  name[a_running_front]
  frames[0, 1, 2, 3]
  delays[150, 150, 150, 150]
}

animation{
  name[a_running_left]
  frames[4, 5, 6, 7]
  delays[150]
}

animation{
  name[a_running_right]
  frames[8, 9, 10, 11]
  delays[150]
}

animation{
  name[a_running_back]
  frames[12, 13, 14, 15]
  delays[150]
}
