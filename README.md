# Wolfen-Doo

Welcome to the Wolfen-Doo project !
This project was first created as a school project to help me learn game programming and stuff.
But ultimately I wanted to make a real game out of this, in the spirit of (and you may have already guessed) Wolfenstein 3D.

# What's done :
 * Fully working 3D game engine
 * Character movements and simple AABB collisions with the world
 * Map generator (from custom file or Maze generation)
 * Fully working sprite animations with configurable file
 * Particle system
 * Doors
 * Weapons (Revolver only for now)

# What's left :
 * Level transitions
 * Dungeon generator
 * Customizable particles
 * Prototype for A.I.
 * Scooby-doo and confettis
 * ...

# How to play ?
Download the whole repo and double click 'start.bat' (Java is required by the way) (Windows only ATM).
Controls are ZQSD to move around (sorry qwerty folks), left click shoots and middle click frees the cursor.
E open doors and R reloads.
1-2 Changes the value of Zfar, try it !
